# Mnemonic Stack Trainer

A modern web application for practicing and mastering memorized card stacks used in magic performances. Built with SolidJS for blazing-fast performance.

> 🎨 **Vibe coded** — This project was built entirely through AI-assisted development using Cursor.

## Features

### Stack Reference
- **Study Mode** — View complete stack order with position numbers
- **Blind Mode** — Hide cards and reveal by tapping for memory practice
- **Multiple Stacks** — Support for Tamariz, Aronson, and 5th Faro stacks
- **Custom Stacks** — Create and manage your own memorized deck orders

### Practice Modes
Eight specialized training exercises to master your stack:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Card → Position** | Identify the position of a given card |
| **Position → Card** | Identify which card is at a given position |
| **One Ahead** | Practice predicting the next card in sequence |
| **Stack in Context** | Learn card relationships (previous/next cards) |
| **First or Second Half** | Determine if a card is in positions 1-26 or 27-52 |
| **Quartet Position** | Locate all four cards of the same rank |
| **Cut to Position** | Calculate which card to cut to for a target position |
| **Cutting Estimation** | Calculate cuts needed to reach target cards (±8 tolerance) |

### Analytics
- **Overall Accuracy** — Track your success rate across all sessions
- **Per-Mode Performance** — Monitor accuracy for each practice mode
- **Recent Performance** — View last 10 attempts, current streak, and trends
- **Failure Tracking** — Identify your most missed cards and positions

### Settings
- **Stack Selection** — Switch between preset and custom stacks
- **Practice Range** — Focus on specific card positions (e.g., 1-26)
- **Dark Mode** — Eye-friendly dark theme
- **Sound Effects** — Audio feedback for correct/incorrect answers
